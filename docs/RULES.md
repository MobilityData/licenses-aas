## License Rules and Metadata

Each license includes a list of `rules` declared in `data/rules.json`. These are grouped into three categories:

- **Permissions** – What the license explicitly allows (e.g., commercial use, modification)
- **Conditions** – What the license requires (e.g., attribution, share-alike)
- **Limitations** – What the license prohibits or disclaims (e.g., warranty, liability)
